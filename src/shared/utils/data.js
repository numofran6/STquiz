    body: "Issa, man, Issa is the dream client who doesn't care about fashion. At this point, I feel like I honestly know what she likes or what her extremes are. But I really, really love that she doesn't care about fashion. That's probably one of the most inspiring things because you work with so many people that care too much. We were doing the Golden Globes one year, and that's when everyone wore black, and so she ended up wearing black, and I wanted an emerald necklace. I hit up a good friend Lorraine [Schwartz]. I was like, I need a custom necklace. Issa didn't care about a diamond necklace. It was not like she didn't care; it's a little bit more like she has so many more amazing things that she's doing in life. It was like, oh, cool, it's nice.",

    body: "As the ambassador of Coach, the “Montero” hitmaker worked with Stuart Vevers, creative director of the brand, to curate its Resort 2024 collection of bright pinks, orange and electric blues. Titled The Lil Nas X Drop, the Coach Resort 2024 collection was curated by the singer and designed by Vevers.“We took inspiration from Lil Nas. We then asked him to curate his favourite pieces from the collection. So we took inspiration from him, created the collection and then asked him his favourite pieces,” Vevers told Vogue Magazine. “We're celebrating LGBTQIA+ communities everywhere, this June and every month. This year marks a decade of partnership between the Coach Foundation and the @hetrickmartin Institute, and continuing partnerships with @pointfoundation and @lgbtcenterlink. All three organisations create supportive environments where LGBTQIA+ young people can thrive,” wrote Coach on Instagram.",

    body: 'Since their first collaboration back in 2020, adidas and Wales Bonner are yet to put a foot wrong. Following the success of their first drop (which saw the footwear pop up on resale sites for nearly twice their retail price), Wales Bonner and adidas have gone on to drop banger after banger, including a slew of collaborative adidas Sambas which have played a big part in the silhouette’s recent rise. Naturally, the Samba is making yet another an appearance for SS23 (this time with an extra long tongue) in two distinct makeups: one in a neutral color palette with a nubuck upper and leather stripes, the other with a silver leather upper and crochet stripes.',

    body: "'Catastrophic implosion' – The unthinkable became all-too-real this past week as we learned of the fate of undersea explorer Stockton Rush's Titan submersible on its way to the Atlantic grave of the TItanic. The questions and the second-guessing, David Pogue tells us, are likely to continue for a long time to come: Last summer, a company called OceanGate invited 'Sunday Morning' to join an expedition to the Titanic. At the time, I was thrilled! As the whole world knows now, OceanGate's business was taking adventure seekers on these Titanic dives for $250,000 a ticket, on a one-of-a-kind carbon fiber submersible called the Titan. 'Carbon fiber is a great material,' said Stockton Rush: the CEO of OceanGate and designer of the sub. 'It's better than titanium, it's better than a lot of other materials.' Last Sunday, as Rush was piloting the sub to the Titanic, it imploded, killing him and his four passengers. We spent nine days at sea with Rush last summer. In light of the tragic news, we thought you might like to see more of what we saw, and hear more of what Stockton Rush said.",

    body: "I get so many questions about how to cook spaghetti squash, so I thought I’d share my go-to method for roasting it, a few tips, and a couple of my favorite spaghetti squash recipes. First things first: cut it in half lengthwise. Then, scoop out the seeds. Next, drizzle the insides lightly with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. I find that adding too much oil and too much salt at this stage makes the squash a bit watery, so a light drizzle and a light sprinkle will do. A mistake I used to make was roasting my squash too long. I used to roast it for an hour or longer, but now I roast it for 30 to 40 minutes. I initially thought the squash needed to be super soft and fork tender in order for the strands to “spaghetti,” but over the years I’ve learned that I prefer my strands to be more al dente (and less mushy), and that the 1 hour mark was too long. Of course, the timing will entirely depend on the size of your squash and the heat of your particular oven. It can also vary from squash to squash, so adjust your cooking time accordingly.",
